          <p>
              My name is Leonardo. I'm a programmer from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, currently living in Portugal and completing my graduation.<br/><br/>
              I have a job at an influential programming company in Portugal, and I'm planning to continue my studies.<br/><br/>
              I am familiar with several programmingges, and I can easily learn new ones. I enjoy learning new design patterns and implementing them in my projects.<br/><br/>
              In the future, I hope to enhance my programming knowledge through work experience, and I am also planning to move to another country to improve my English skills.<br/><br/>

              <p>
                Going to the gym has become a very important part of my life, a place of socializing for people who strive for a better and healthier lifestyle through effort. <br/><br/>
                There is no easy way to achieve gains, there are no better or worse ones, there are only those who are more hardworking and consistent. <br/><br/>
                This lifestyle demands more effort, is more painful, and requires more energy, but seeing how my body improves in terms of strength and aesthetics is priceless.

              <p>
                Music has been an important part of my life since forever. <br/><br/>
                I grew up listening to classNameic Brazilian and foreign music. Wherever I go, I carry headphones with me and several downloaded songs. <br/><br/>
                My favorite music genres are pop, rock, and jazz, and almost anything that originates from them. I have an open mind to new bands and new styles. <br/><br/>
                The Weeknd, Lana Del Rey, Pink Floyd, The Alan Parsons Project, Tyler, The Creator, and Arctic Monkeys are always among the most played songs of the day.

                But if I had to choose one, my favorite hobby is definitely traveling. <br/><br/>
                I enjoy everything about traveling, from planning the flights and packing my suitcase to the feeling of leaving the house locked up. I love the excitement of arriving at the airport, the journey on the plane, and immersing myself in a new culture in a new country with new sights and cuisine. <br/><br/>
                So far, I haven't traveled to many places, but I have several photographs of where I've been, and I'm definitely going to see the whole world when I start having my own money.
